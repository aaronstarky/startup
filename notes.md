## GitHub
### Merge Conflicts
Merge conflicts occur when the same line of code is edited in two different places and someone tries to pull those changes into their current branch. You can resolve this using the visual studio GUI tools and CLI tools.


Times it can occur:
- you make change to line 27. Line 27 has new change in github and you attempt to pull that change onto your local machine.
